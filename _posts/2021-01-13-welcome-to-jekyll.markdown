I'll be reviewing the book "Ardent C++ Programming" written by Sungwoo Yoon.
The book consists of 16 chapters as follows:
| #  | Chapter Name |
| -- | -----|
| 1  | C++ Based on C (1) |
| 2  | C++ Based on C (2) |
| 3  | Class Basics |
| 4  | Class Completion |
| 5  | Copy Constructor |
| 6  | friend, static, and const |
| 7  | Understanding Inheritance |
| 8  | Inheritance and Polymorphism |
| 9  | Copy Constructor |



Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
